## About

Open source research efforts within the University of California face many challenges, including

- Educating students to be productive in open source projects
- Revealing the value of open source to the UC system
- Broadening engagement with industry, government, and foundations

The UCSC OSPO effort was founded by {{% mention "carlosm" %}} and {{% mention "slieggi" %}} in 2022 under an [Alfred P Sloan Foundation Grant](https://research.redhat.com/blog/article/building-a-university-ospo-bolstering-academic-research-through-open-source/). The effort continues under the leadership of Lieggi and Faculty Director [James Davis](https://news.ucsc.edu/2024/02/davis-cross-director.html), along with OSPO incubator fellow {{%mention "elovell" %}}.  The UCSC OSPO team, along with partners at other UC campuses, is

- Developing a community of practice of open source software projects across the UC system and associated national labs that brings mentors, students, sponsors, and open source stakeholders together
- Establishing infrastructure and opportunities for researchers to grow communities around their open source projects  
- Organizing a yearly undergraduate [Open Source Research Experience](/content/osre24/index.md), a UC-wide mentorship program that works with Google Summer of Code and other global outreach efforts and engages with industry, government, and foundation sponsorships
- Creating partnerships with innovative open source teaching initiatives inside and outside the UC system

The UCSC OSPO mission is to leverage open source to expand the reach and impact of research coming from throughout the UC system.
